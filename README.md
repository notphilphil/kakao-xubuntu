## 1. Introduction

This project serves many purposes; first and foremost it serves a purpose to me as being an exercise in learning and practicing multiple useful skills like C++ and Markdown, as well as give me experience reading and writing multi-lingual documentation.

Second, I hope this can serve as being a solution to using [KakaoTalk][4] on machines that have Linux operating system installed. KakaoTalk currently supports two desktop clients: one for Windows and one for Mac OS X ([download][3]). However, the solutions for a machine that runs a [Linux flavor][5] seem to be lacking. KakaoTalk does not advertise any software product for Linux machines, and the solutions that do exist online might not be user friendly, save for [this example][6], though if you do not speak Korean you might find it hard to follow the installation guide.
